Finish getting your EC2 instance set up and be able to run the lesson 1 notebook. If you have any problems, you can post questions on the AWS setup topic or the running lesson 1 notebook topic.
Set up the kaggle CLI397, and use it to download data for the Dogs vs Cats: Redux415 competition (a different dataset than the one we shared with you) to your EC2 instance.
Successfully submit to the above competition, using kaggle-cli, and try to get in the top 50%
Modify the lesson 1 notebook to work with the new dataset.
Look through other image data sets225 and choose one to work on during the course. You should talk with your group about whether you all want to work on the same dataset or not (either is fine). Check if a forum thread already exists for that dataset, and if not, create one. You can use the thread to talk with other students who are working with the same dataset.
Download the data to your EC2 instance, and modify the lesson 1 notebook to run on a sample subset of the data.
